  number - (number * 2)
end

# I want to return the negative number of the one I'm fed 
# I would take the number, and then minus 2 * the number from the current numer 
# so e.g. 10 I would minus 20 from 10 to get -10
# also e.g. for 40 I would minus (2 * 40.= 80) to get -40 
# number - (number * 2) 
# for negative numbers, e.g. -10 - (-10 * 2) is -10 - -20 = 20
